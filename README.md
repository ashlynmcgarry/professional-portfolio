This professional portfolio has been created for myself, Ashlyn McGarry, as I begins my career in web development. In doing this I aim to appeal to prospective employers and showcase my skills and applications as well as provide a breif bio and contact details. By utilising semantic HTML elements, advanced CSS styling techniques and optimising for accessiblity standards, I hope to showcase my web development work and create a platform I can add to as my career progresses. 

Throughout this project I learned how to create a web application from start to finish utilising both HTML and CSS. From here, I was able to style the application to my tastes as well as ensrue it is responsive to a variety of screen sizes. In doing this, I was able to use a CSS reset and hone my skills in utilising a Flexbox layout.
